# Configuration

eQual allows to define globally some values that are used across the different services as configuration properties.  

These properties are defined through config files. 

eQual supports cascading configuration : each package can have a config file of its own that defines specific properties or overwrites existing properties.  

Config files are optional, and the default values for mandatory properties are listed in the configuration schema (see below). 

## schema.json

A `schema.json` file is located under the `./config/` folder. That file holds a comprehensive description of the role and usage of each available constant. This file is not meant to be modified. Instead, constants that must be modified according to the current environment can be set in a `config.json` file.

## config.json

Customization can be achieved by using a custom `config.json` file that must be placed under : `./config/` along with the `schema.json`.  

Properties are exported as (global) constants. Services, controllers and classes are responsible of announcing which constants they expect (through a `getConstants()` method). If one of the required constant is missing, an exception is raised.


Settings values defined in config files must always be called by using the `constant()` function. This is because, since they're not defined at the moment the parsing is done, using literal notation would result in warnings and wrong values assignments.

Some constants might be required by mandatory services. Those must therefore be defined immediately when the config file is read. Those properties are marked as 'instant'.  When no value is given in `config.json` for such property, if a 'default' or an 'environment' property is set in the `schema.json`, the constant is declared using the retrieved value, if not, the property is ignored and no constant is defined, unless the property is also marked as 'required' in which case an Exception is raised.

The list below shows the details for supported constants and their roles.

!!! note "About integer values"  
    Properties holding an integer value can be given as a string that supports the following shorthand notations (case-sensitive):

    * memory notation (converted in bytes)
        * KB (for KiloBytes)
        * MB (for MegaBytes) 
        * GB (for GigaBytes)
    
    * time notations (converted in seconds)
        * s for seconds (default)
        * m for minutes (=60s)
        * h for hours (=60m)
        * d for days (=24h)
        * w for weeks (=7d)
        * M for months (=4w)
        * Y for years (=12m)



## UI configuration 

In order to bootstrap communication with the back-end, the front-end needs some information. To that end, a configuration file is expected under `./public/assets/env/config.json` to hold a series of public details that are needed by the UI.

That file can be generated manually or using the `init` controller.

The properties, roles and default values are describes in the list below.

|name|default value|origin|
|-|-|-|
|production|true|ENV_MODE|
|parent_domain|equal.local|parse_url(ROOT_APP_URL, PHP_URL_HOST)|
|backend_url|http://equal.local|ROOT_APP_URL|
